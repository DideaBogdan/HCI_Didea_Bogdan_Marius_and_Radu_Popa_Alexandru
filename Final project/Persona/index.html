                                As his parents have told him numerous times before, his diet has to change for the better and so he wants to drop any misconceptions about certain food categories (such as fish or raw vegetables) and also to improve his diet, leading to a healthier lifestyle.

                        Alex is an enthusiastic and curious child. They are eager to learn and try new things. Alex is open-minded and willing to embrace new experiences. They have a caring nature and enjoy helping others. They have a vivid imagination and enjoy storytelling
                        and playing make-believe games.

                    <p>
                        Alex's parents have recently realized that their child's diet has been quite limited, consisting mostly of a few staple foods. Concerned about their child's nutrition and wanting to broaden their palate, they have decided to introduce him to a mobile
                        application that recommends various products and dietary choices for anyone including children.

                            As a picky eater, he wants to try from time to time to eat more diverse food and learn more about it: how to cook it and where to find the prime ingredients.

                        Whenever Alex selects a food item, the application provides nutritional information, including the benefits and potential allergies or sensitivities. Alex enjoys looking at the pictures of different meals and recipes suggested by the app.

                    <li>
                        As Alex starts trying new foods, the application allows him to record his experiences and rate the items they have tried. He also has the option to save the items, which helps him remember which foods he enjoyed the most and which ones he would like to
                        try again in the future. Through the application, Alex not only learns about nutrition but also gains an appreciation for the variety of flavors and textures available in different foods.

                                Gabriela may experience frustrations if the application has a limited database of diabetes-friendly foods and recipes. If the app does not offer a wide variety of options or fails to update its content regularly, Gabriela may find it challenging to maintain
                                a diverse and interesting diet. This limitation could lead to monotony and decreased motivation to use the app consistently.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Accurate and up-to-date nutritional information is crucial for Gabriela's diabetes management. If the application provides incomplete or incorrect nutritional data for certain foods, it can be both frustrating and potentially harmful to her health. Gabriela
                                relies on the app to make informed decisions about her dietary choices, so any inconsistencies or inaccuracies may undermine her trust in the application.

                            <li>
                                If the application does not effectively personalize its recommendations based on Gabriela's specific needs and preferences, she may find it challenging to incorporate the app's suggestions into her daily routine. A one-size-fits-all approach may not cater
                                to her individual requirements, making it difficult for Gabriela to align her dietary choices with her diabetes management plan.;

                        Gabriela is a warm-hearted and independent individual. She values her health and strives to maintain a balanced lifestyle. She is a quick learner and embraces technology with the help of her tech-savvy nephews. Gabriela is determined and proactive when
                        it comes to managing her diabetes, and she is motivated to make positive changes to her diet and overall well-being.

                    <p>
                        She recently retired and has been diagnosed with diabetes. Realizing the importance of maintaining a healthy diet to manage her condition, she decided to explore the world of mobile applications to help her make informed choices. Her nephews, who are
                        well-versed in technology, have assisted her in finding and setting up an application that recommends products, including dietary recommendations tailored to her needs.

                            She wants to consistently maintain healthy blood sugar levels within the recommended range. This goal would involve regularly monitoring her blood sugar levels, adhering to her prescribed medication or insulin regimen, and making well-informed food choices
                            based on the application's recommendations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A personal goal could be to expand her culinary skills and explore a variety of diabetes-friendly recipes. She could aim to try at least one new recipe each week from the application's collection, experimenting with different flavors and ingredients.
                            This goal would not only make her meals more enjoyable but also boost her confidence in managing her diabetes through delicious and nutritious home-cooked meals.
