								<li>He aims to become healthier and to learn how to use mobile devices.</li>

						<div class="leftGroup">
							<h5>Goals</h5>
							<ul>
								<li>Practical Goals:</li>
								<p>
									Alex wants to grow more accustomed to technology and use it on a day to day basis.
									Coming from a poor family, living with his older sisters in the countryside,
									anything tech related is very out of reach for him.
								</p>
								<li>Personal Goals:</li>
								<p>
									As his parents have told him numerous times before, his diet has to change for the
									better and so he wants to drop any misconceptions about certain food categories
									(such as fish or raw vegetables) and also to improve his diet, leading to a
									healthier lifestyle.
								</p>
							</ul>
						</div>
						<div class="leftGroup">
							<h5>Frustrations and Pain Points</h5>
							<ul>
								<li>
									The UI colors don't feel very attractive, maybe they are meant for an older age
									group and not so much for kids.
								</li>
								<li>
									He has always avoided trying new kinds of food out of fear that he might not enjoy
									it
								</li>
								<li>
									Overall the user experience can be improved, it is slightly difficult to navigate
									the main screen when you want to do a certain thing, for example to see what your
									friends are doing.
								</li>

						<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
						<p>
							Alex is an enthusiastic and curious child. They are eager to learn and try new things. Alex
							is open-minded and willing to embrace new experiences. They have a caring nature and enjoy
							helping others. They have a vivid imagination and enjoy storytelling and playing
							make-believe games.
						</p>
						<p>
							Alex's parents have recently realized that their child's diet has been quite limited,
							consisting mostly of a few staple foods. Concerned about their child's nutrition and wanting
							to broaden their palate, they have decided to introduce him to a mobile application that
							recommends various products and dietary choices for anyone including children.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								As a child that has lived his entire life in the countryside, he wants to familiarize
								himself with the technological advancements so that he can more easily find help for
								himself in the future and also communicate online with his classmates.
							</li>
							<li>
								As a picky eater, he wants to try from time to time to eat more diverse food and learn
								more about it: how to cook it and where to find the prime ingredients.

						<li>
							Whenever Alex selects a food item, the application provides nutritional information,
							including the benefits and potential allergies or sensitivities. Alex enjoys looking at the
							pictures of different meals and recipes suggested by the app.
						</li>
						<li>
							As Alex starts trying new foods, the application allows him to record his experiences and
							rate the items they have tried. He also has the option to save the items, which helps him
							remember which foods he enjoyed the most and which ones he would like to try again in the
							future. Through the application, Alex not only learns about nutrition but also gains an
							appreciation for the variety of flavors and textures available in different foods.

							<h5>Frustrations and Pain Points</h5>
							<p>Some of the difficulties the user has with the product.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Gabriela may experience frustrations if the application has a limited database of
									diabetes-friendly foods and recipes. If the app does not offer a wide variety of
									options or fails to update its content regularly, Gabriela may find it challenging
									to maintain a diverse and interesting diet. This limitation could lead to monotony
									and decreased motivation to use the app consistently.
								</li>
								<li>
									Accurate and up-to-date nutritional information is crucial for Gabriela's diabetes
									management. If the application provides incomplete or incorrect nutritional data for
									certain foods, it can be both frustrating and potentially harmful to her health.
									Gabriela relies on the app to make informed decisions about her dietary choices, so
									any inconsistencies or inaccuracies may undermine her trust in the application.
								</li>
								<li>
									If the application does not effectively personalize its recommendations based on
									Gabriela's specific needs and preferences, she may find it challenging to
									incorporate the app's suggestions into her daily routine. A one-size-fits-all
									approach may not cater to her individual requirements, making it difficult for
									Gabriela to align her dietary choices with her diabetes management plan.;
								</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div itemprop="description" class="detailsRight">
						<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
						<p>
							Gabriela enjoys spending time with her family, reading books, gardening, and staying active
							through gentle exercises like walking and yoga. She is also passionate about cooking and
							trying out new recipes.
						</p>
						<p>
							Gabriela is a warm-hearted and independent individual. She values her health and strives to
							maintain a balanced lifestyle. She is a quick learner and embraces technology with the help
							of her tech-savvy nephews. Gabriela is determined and proactive when it comes to managing
							her diabetes, and she is motivated to make positive changes to her diet and overall
							well-being.
						</p>
						<p>
							She recently retired and has been diagnosed with diabetes. Realizing the importance of
							maintaining a healthy diet to manage her condition, she decided to explore the world of
							mobile applications to help her make informed choices. Her nephews, who are well-versed in
							technology, have assisted her in finding and setting up an application that recommends
							products, including dietary recommendations tailored to her needs.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								She wants to consistently maintain healthy blood sugar levels within the recommended
								range. This goal would involve regularly monitoring her blood sugar levels, adhering to
								her prescribed medication or insulin regimen, and making well-informed food choices
								based on the application's recommendations.
							</li>
							<li>
								A personal goal could be to expand her culinary skills and explore a variety of
								diabetes-friendly recipes. She could aim to try at least one new recipe each week from
								the application's collection, experimenting with different flavors and ingredients. This
								goal would not only make her meals more enjoyable but also boost her confidence in
								managing her diabetes through delicious and nutritious home-cooked meals.
							</li>
							<li>Business Goals like: increasing student enrollment, getting good education.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Prior experience:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Somewhat accustomed to mobile applications, she knows how to navigate the screens and
								stays sharp about the latest news.
