    <h1>Remote communications - Zoom and Webex</h1>
    <h4 id="affordances">
        Existing affordances, visual variables and interaction flows in case of delivering an academic presentation.
    </h4>
    <p style="font-weight: bold">Affordances</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Audio controls: a user can mute or unmute the microphone, select input microphone or the output speakers. Also you can mute/unmute other participants.
        </li>
        <li>
            Video controls: a user can turn on or off their camera, select which camera to use if multiple are present, use virtual backgrounds / blur, change orientation.
        </li>
        <li>Button for the participants list.</li>
        <li>
            Sharing the screen: the user can share the screen with other participants, which is an important affordance for an academic presentation, business meeting or demonstrating a proof of concept.
        </li>
        <li>
            Having a reaction: a user can present a reaction -emoji- so they can interact with other users without disturbing the host (for example a professor or a project manager).
        </li>
        <li>Apps: integration with third party apps so the workflow is facilitated.</li>
        <li>Whiteboards: a user can start a whiteboard, which is also important in academic presentation.</li>
        <li>
            Chat: it provides the users with the possibility of communicating non-verbally, writing in chat. For example having a question in chat so that the presenter will not be interrupted.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p style="font-weight: bold">Visual variables</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Screen layout: the possibility to have the user speaking or presenting "in front", in a big picture, while the other users are listed in smaller pictures. Another possibility is to have all the users be in the gallery mode, having equal proportions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Video quality: in very large meetings, a big chunk of data has to be rendered, so in this cases having the possibility to adjust the video quality of every participant is important.
        </li>
        <li>The possibility to change the displayed name.</li>
        <li>
            The possibility to share specific applications open at that time, screens, portions of the screen or whiteboards.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p style="font-weight: bold">Interaction flow</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Before-presentation: the presenter can set up the meeting details, share the meeting link, test the audio and video settings, like muting everybody on join.
        </li>
        <li>
            During presentation: the presenter can control video and audio or the participants, can share the screen and more others. Below is a diagram of what a user's interaction flow can be (in case of Zoom). For Webex, the interaction flow is very similar.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <img src="Interaction_flow.jpg" alt="Interaction flow" width="50%" height="50%" />

    <h4 id="visual-metaphors">Comparing the visual metaphors and idioms and suggesting new ones.</h4>
    <img src="Toolbox.png" alt="Toolbox" width="100%" height="100%" />
    <p>
        The image above is showing the bar of actions for Webex(left) and Zoom(right). The visual metaphors and idioms are fairly similar, like the mute/unmute and start/stop video buttons. The same is for the share and record buttons. Webex has a quick button
        for raising a hand, while in Zoom all the reactions are placed in the Reactions menu (so one click to raise a hand in Webex vs. 2 clicks in Zoom). Webex has a "More options" idiom, with the visual metaphor of 3 dots. For the "Exit the meeting"
        button Webex has just a visual metaphor, meanwhile Zoom has a red button with the idiom "End". The same if for the "Apps", "Participants" and "Chat" options, Webex having just the visual metaphors, while Zoom has both idioms and visual metaphors.
        Zoom has a "Whiteboard" option in the tools bar, while Webex has it stored in the "Share" button. All the visual metaphors and idioms are fairly similar.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the text-only interaction part, supposing that every interaction possible with the app would be possible in text-only (for example if the user wants to open the gallery of participants a new window will appear), all the commands would be:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>mic_mute / mic_unmute : microphone controls</li>
        <li>get_mic_inputs : prints the input devices for audio</li>
        <li>set_mic_input *the device* : sets the audio input device</li>
        <li>get_speaker_outputs : prints the output devices for audio</li>
        <li>set_speaker_output *the device* : sets the audio output device</li>
        <li>start_video : starts the camera</li>
        <li>stop_video : stops the camera</li>
        <li>get_video_devices : prints the video devices</li>
        <li>set_video_device *the device* : sets the device used for video</li>
        <li>print_participants : prints the participants of the meeting</li>
        <li>to_chat : opens a new window where the chat is displayed</li>
        <li>exit : exits the meeting</li>
        <li>view_speaker : opens a window which visualizes the video of the speaker</li>
        <li>view_gallery : opens a window which visualizes all the participant's videos</li>
        <li>get_screen : opens a window where a screen or all the screens shared can be seen</li>
        <li>share_screen : you share your screen so the other participants can see it</li>
        <li>get_invite_link : prints a link of the current meeting</li>
        <li>mute_user *username* : mutes a specific participant</li>
        <li>mute_all : mutes all participants</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="cognitive-overload">Discussing the cognitive overload in special contexts</h4>
    <p>
        The apps are quite easy to understand and work with, with 3 colors, pretty good idioms and visual metaphors, the menus do not have too many options and are not cascading. So, it can be said that Webex and Zoom are pretty intuitive apps.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some special contexts where cognitive overload could appear would be when every participant has a camera on, microphone on and is sharing some content. Also, the chat is heavily used and a normal user can't see all the messages. So it can get quite annoying
        for a user. Both Webex and Zoom have meeting settings that can prevent most of this previously said occurrences. For example, the owner of the meeting can choose if a user can share some content at all or if multiple participants can share a screen
        at the same time. Also, the owner can mute all the participants if needed. For example Zoom has the Security menu, where the owner can set what a user can or can not do, like unmuting themselves, start their video camera or sharing content. With
        this option, the cognitive overload can be reduced drastically for all the participants.
    </p>

    <h4 id="improvements">UI/UX Improvements</h4>
    <p>
        While both Zoom and Webex are applications used world wide to hold meetings ranging from personal to professional use, they do not provide an ideal user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        Starting off with Zoom, the mobile application has a completely different design from the desktop one, in order to accommodate with the smaller screen size and the possible use cases. Both the mobile and desktop apps focus on communication (verbal through
        audio-video transmission or non-verbal through screen sharing), however the desktop app is more modular (some UI elements are popups and others open menus that do not obstruct the current presentation/participants' video). Which is why the mobile
        app has the following flaws:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p style="margin: 0px">
                Tapping on the "chat" button completely hides the previous screen and replaces it with a new one. From this new screen it is impossible to see the current presentation or the other meeting members. Sending or even just reading messages sent by other users
                block one's capability to participate to the meeting, thus possibly making them miss important details.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px">
                A solution to combat this issue would be to make the chat menu a popup, maybe a bubble like those implemented in Android 11, or to split the screen to allow the user to see the chat and the meeting at the same time.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p style="margin: 0px">
                Privacy indicators are a new addition to Android (version 12+) and iOs (version 14+) and they let the user know whenever an app is using either the microphone or the camera by showing an indicator in the status bar. Users tend to concerned if the indicator
                appears when they are not expecting it, and unfortunately Zoom falls into this trap too. The microphone dot remains visible even if the user is muted, a user might think that they can still be heard and become paranoid.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px">
                The simple way to resolve this problem is to drop the resources allocated for the microphone once the user has been muted for a given time (at least 5 seconds should be fine). This way, if the user accidentally muted themselves, the app would not drop
                and reacquire resources for the microphone control, but only do so in scenarios where the behavior was intentional.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p style="margin: 0px">
                As for the UI, most of the menus are consistent with those of the operating system, however, the "schedule" menu that can be accessed from the main screen and is used especially by those who want to host a meeting has a striking iOs-like look. The text
                categories, option toggles, date/time picker look like they copied the iOs design and made it available for Android. This makes the interface inconsistent, the users are expecting the interface to look a certain way, but may become confused
                when looking at this alien alternative.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0px">
                They could have instead used an interface similar to the Google Calendar event planning menu, but this would make the applications have different interfaces. So a better solution would be to make a new interface that can be used for both applications,
                a minimal interface that is easy to understand and use regardless of the platform.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4 id="empiric-laws">Empiric laws</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Fitt's law predicts the time required to quickly move to a target area, such as a button or a menu item, as a function of the distance to the target and the size of the target. The time required to move to a target id proportional to the distance to the
                target and inversely proportional to the size of the target. So the closer and bigger the target is, the smaller the time needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Multi-device interaction can be used to enhance the user experience of the Zoom/Webex application in several ways, including enabling multi device screen sharing. This could allow users to share their screen during a call from any device, making it easier
                to collaborate and present information. For example, a user could start sharing their screen from their laptop, and then switch to their tablet to draw on a presentation or highlight key points. Or they can use a phone's microphone and
                front facing camera for the meeting, and a desktop for screen sharing.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a user needs to switch between different devices while screen sharing, the buttons or controls that allow them to do so should be large and easy to locate. They should also be placed in a location that is easily accessible and intuitive for the user.
                This could mean placing the buttons in a fixed location on the screen or adapting their placement based on the device being used.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Hick's law is a psychological principle in human-computer interaction that describes the relationship between the number of options presented to a user and the time it takes for them to make a decision. Specifically, Hick's law states that as the number
                of options increases, the time it takes to make a decision also increases logarithmically.
            </p>
            <p>
                To avoid this problem, designers should aim to simplify the user interface and reduce the number of options presented to the user. This can be achieved by grouping similar options together, using clear and concise language to describe each option, and
                providing visual cues and affordances to help guide the user's attention to important options.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, presenting too many device options to switch between or too many controls to adjust the screen size or layout could overwhelm the user and increase decision-making time. Instead of presenting every device option available for screen sharing,
                designers could limit the options to only those devices that are currently connected or within a certain proximity.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Steering's law, also known as the reciprocal tapping task, is a fundamental principle in human-computer interaction that describes the relationship between the width of a target and the speed and accuracy of movement towards that target. The law states
                that the time taken to steer a cursor or pointer towards a target is a function of the distance to the target and the width of the target. Specifically, the law states that as the width of the target increases, movement time decreases,
                while accuracy increases.
            </p>
            <p>
                Steering's law has important implications for the design of user interfaces, particularly for the placement and sizing of interactive elements, such as buttons and links. By designing buttons and other interactive elements with an appropriate size and
                spacing, designers can improve both the speed and accuracy with which users interact with these elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, designers could use larger and more easily distinguishable icons to represent different device options or controls for adjusting the screen size or layout. They could also ensure that interactive elements are placed in locations that are
                easily accessible and intuitive for the user, such as in a fixed location on the screen or adapted based on the user's device and screen size. This will also ensure that users do not accidentally share the screen of a device they don't
                indent to, or don't use the camera from a device other than the ones they want.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4 id="features">Improving the user experience</h4>
    <p>
        Both Zoom and Webex are improving day by day, but some there are some features that might make a bigger difference than others:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Whiteboard Collaboration
            <p>
                A feature completely missing from both applications that could be added is a collaborative whiteboard. This would allow users to work together on a shared digital canvas during meetings, making it easier to brainstorm and share ideas. A collaborative
                whiteboard can encourage participants to actively engage in the conversation by allowing them to share their ideas and collaborate with others. It can also make online meetings feel more interactive and dynamic, leading to higher levels
                of participation and engagement. A collaborative whiteboard can streamline the meeting process by allowing participants to share their ideas and work collaboratively, in real-time. This can save time and reduce misunderstandings and miscommunications.
            </p>
            <img src="whiteboard_collaboration.png" alt="whiteboard collaboration sketch" />
        </li>
        <li>
            Restricted Screen Sharing
            <p>
                A third feature that could be added is an improved screen sharing capability. This could include the ability to share specific application windows or tabs rather than the entire screen, as well as the ability to annotate and highlight important points
                on the shared screen. This would make it easier for users to share information and collaborate during meetings. Sharing the entire screen might expose personal or unwanted information and it makes it hard to present something while also
                having to look at some notes. This can be mitigated if the applications allowed for only sharing a portion of the screen or only one or multiple applications.
            </p>
            <img src="restricted_sharing.png" alt="restricted sharing sketch" />
        </li>
        <li>
            Advanced Screen sharing
            <p>
                At the moment, both applications use the resolution of the person sharing their screen and a low frame rate. This is ideal in most situations, as there is no need for more frame rate for a presentation, which is why resolution is prioritized. However,
                designers and art creators will not find this functionality to be sufficient if they are presenting a gif or a short clip and are requesting feedback. Frame rate is important when sharing this kind of media, but resolution is not. In the
                case of game developers, 3D model artists, or special effects, both resolution and frame rate are important, but a third metric might be even more important: bitrate. It doesn't matter if the shared content is full hd with high framerate,
                if the image has compression artifacts, you can be sure nobody is going to understand anything. Both applications should add an "Advanced" option for screen sharing that allows the user to customize all of these properties before sharing
                their screen.
            </p>
            <img src="advanced_sharing.png" alt="advanced sharing sketch" />
